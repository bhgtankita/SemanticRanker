Retrieval Augmented generation sometimes gives amazing results but often times not as good as what we are expecting. The easiest and fastest way to make RAG pipeline better is reranking the retieved documents. 

To ensure the faster search times we use vector search with the retrieval process. It will transform the text into Vectors, place them all into a vector space and compare there proximity to the query vector and find the closest vectors.
