Arjuna,\\nthePāṇḍava, discovers the problem of saṃsāra in the battlefield. He\\nsurrenders to Lord Kṛṣṇa seeking a solution. Then follows the great\\nteaching.\\nIf one should get the Gītā-wisdom, one should go through some\\nimportant phases in one’s life.\\nFirstly, one should discover the problem of saṃsāra , for which\\nGītā happens to be a solution', ' Unless one discovers the disease, one\\nwill not seek medicine.\\nSecondly, one should become possessed by a sincere longing\\n(tīvramumukṣā ) for freedom from saṃsāra. This alone can lead to\\ncommitted and fruitful pursuit.\\nThirdly, one should realize that one cannot solve this problem\\nindependently. The maximum that one can do, as a limited human\\nbeing, is a rearrangement or a reshapement of the problem.\\nFinally, one should surrender to a guru seeking his guidance', '\\nWhen discovers the śiṣya in one and surrenders to a guru , the ground\\nis prepared for the Gītā-teaching to take place.\\nThe entire first chapter and the first part of the second chapter are\\ndevoted to show these developments.)\\nThe problem of saṃsāra, as shown in the first chapter, can be said\\nto be the problem of attachment ( kṛpā orrāga), grief (śoka orviṣāda)\\nand delusion (moha). When one is not happy with oneself, one has to\\nseek external aids. This leads to dependence and attachment', ' Since the\\nconditions of the depended factors are unpredictable, the very peace of\\nmind of that person is in trouble. A disturbed mind can make only\\nfaulty judgements complicating the matters further. Thus a vicious cy-\\ncle is created. This, in short, is the problem of saṃsāra.\\nComing to the text, we find, in the first twenty verses, a vivid\\ndescription of the armies arrayed for battle', ' After a brief instruction\\nofDuryodhana to his commanders, Bhīṣma, Lord Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna, and\\n1others\\nblow their conches, signaling the commencement of the bat-\\ntle (1 to 20).\\nAt this fateful moment, Arjuna commands Lord Kṛṣṇa, his char-\\nioteer, to place the chariot in the middle of the army to scrutinize the\\nenemy-forces. The mischievous Lord brings the chariot in front of\\nBhīṣma andDroṇa and asks Arjuna to survey the army (21 to 25)', '\\n(Till now Arjuna was convinced that his cousins are unrighteous\\n(23) and he, as a kṣatriya, has to fight the battle to establish righteous-\\nness.)\\nIn a moment of weakness, Arjuna slips down from reason to rela-\\ntion. Instead of seeing the violators of dharma , he sees his beloved kith\\nand kin. Naturally, Arjuna is overpowered by attachment. Then follow\\nthe twin offshoots of attachment viz.grief and delusion (26 to 30)', '\\nIn the next five verses, we see Arjuna expressing his intense grief\\nwhich shakes him completely. This indicates the extent of his attach-\\nment.\\nVeiled by attachment, his discriminative power becomes inopera-\\ntive and he commits a series of false judgements. Interestingly enough,\\nArjuna even quotes the scriptures to support his unreasonable stand.\\nThus, Arjuna gets caught up in delusion which is depicted from the\\n36th verse upto the end of the chapter (36 to 47)', '\\nIn this way, Arjuna finds himself in the deep sea of attachment,\\nsorrow and delusion ( rāga,śoka, moha). Arjuna sincerely wants to get\\nout of this problem. He thinks that solution is to drop the battle. But,\\none corner of his mind is not convinced by this. At the same time, he\\nhas not realized that the problem is too deep for him to solve indepen-\\ndently. Hence he doesn’t surrender to Kṛṣṇa either. Thus caught up in\\na dilemma, Arjuna sits back on the chariot sorrowfully', '\\nThe main topics of this chapter are:\\n1.

', ' . . . . . . . . . . . 35 to 47\\nSince Arjuna’s grief is the main topic, this chapter is aptly called\\nArjunaviṣāda-yoga.\\nChapter 2\\nSāṅkhya-yoga\\nIn the first chapter, Arjuna was shown to be completely immersed in\\ngrief ( śoka) caused by attachment ( rāga) and delusion (moha). Inde-\\npendently analyzing the problem, he comes to the conclusion that with-\\ndrawing from the war is the only solution.\\nIn the beginning of the second chapter we see the turning point\\ninArjuna', ' Chastised by Kṛṣṇa (2, 3), Arjuna analyses the situation\\nfurther. This leads to the two important discoveries:\\n1. His weakness of attachment is a fundamental problem which\\ncannot be solved by superficial methods (9).\\n2. He has to surrender completely to a guru to get out of this fun-\\ndamental problem (8).\\nThus, Arjuna becomes a śiṣya by surrendering to Lord Kṛṣṇa.\\nNaturally, Kṛṣṇa also becomes a guru. Now that the guru-śiṣya rela-\\ntionship has been struck, the teaching can begin (10)', '\\n[Once a human being discovers a seeker in him, the guru will be\\nright in front. The vedaantic teaching can take place only between a\\nguru andśiṣya.]\\nKṛṣṇa straightway attacks Arjuna’s idea that war is going to harm\\nBhīṣma or himself. He points out that all the problems of Arjuna are\\nbecause of delusion caused by ignorance, for wise men never have a\\nproblem (11). Thereafter, Kṛṣṇa gives different reasons to establish\\nthatArjuna has to fight this war:\\n1', ' From the stand point of true nature of Ātmā (ādhyātmika-dṛśṭi),\\nBhīṣma and others are immortal. Ātmā is never subject to changes\\n3in\\nspite of the changes of the body. It is neither a doer nor an en-\\njoyer. Hence, neither is Arjuna a slayer nor is Bhīṣma slain. So,\\nwhy should he resist to fight? (12 to 25). Even if the Ātmā is\\nimpermanent, Arjuna should not lament. Whatever appears will\\nhave to disappear and whatever disappears will appear. Hence,\\none should learn to accept the change', ' [In fact, change is the\\nbeauty of the creation. It looks ugly when our outlook is partial\\nor selfish.] Hence, why should Arjuna grieve for the physical\\nseparation from Bhīṣma and others which is inevitable in life?\\n(26 to 30).\\n2. From the stand point of Kṣatriya’s duty ( dhārmika-dṛśṭi), Arjuna\\ncan fight if it is necessary to establish order. A kṣatriya must look\\nat the problem not from personal stand point, but from social\\nstand point (31)', ' Hence, why should Arjuna hesitate to fight for\\na righteous cause? A righteous war is a door to heaven for a\\nkṣatriya (32). If Arjuna avoids war, not only he be shirking his\\nduty and losing heaven, but he will positively incur sin (33). For\\navoiding sin, at least, Arjuna should fight.\\n3. Looking at the situation from worldly angle ( laukika-dṛśṭi), Ar-\\njuna should not withdraw from the war. He will be called a\\ncoward by everyone (including the future generation) (34, 36)', '\\nShouldn’t Arjuna fight to protect his reputation?\\nWith these arguments, Lord persuades Arjuna to fight (37, 38)\\nand concludes the first part of his teaching. He calls this sāṅkhya-yoga\\n(39). [In fact, the first argument which deals with the nature of the\\nĀtmā and the body (ātma-anātma-viveka) alone is the sāṅkhya-yoga.]\\nHereafter, the Lord enters into buddhi-yoga (karma-yoga)', ' [Thou-\\nghsāṅkhya-yoga is the true solution for sorrow, many are not fit to gain\\nit because of the false idea ( moha) that worldly pursuits can solve the\\nproblem. So, initially, one has to be allowed to pursue worldly ends.\\nBy this, one should discover for oneself that actions and their results\\ncannot give permanent satisfaction. This is dispassion. A dispassion-\\nate mind can pursue sāṅkhya-yoga. Thus karma-yoga is introduced as\\na means to come to sāṅkhya-yoga', ']\\n4First,\\nthe Lord describes the glory of karma-yoga (40 to 46). Then\\ncomes the principle of karma-yoga. One can choose one’s action but\\nnever the result. The result is dependent on the laws of action. The\\nother factors of the world, known and unknown, may bring a totally\\nunexpected result. One cannot avoid that. Yet inaction will not be a\\nsolution (47). No one can completely know the laws of action. Hence,\\nactions are often imperfect in spite of effort', ' So, one should ever be\\nready for any result. One can hope for the best, but should be prepared\\nfor the worst. When one acts with the above understanding, success\\nand failure lose their capacity to shake him. One does not react, because\\nhe is not caught unawares. This equanimity in action is yoga (48).\\nThus, one can convert the binding karma into a valid teacher. This\\nis skill in action (50). A tranquil mind will soon shed its false value\\nattributed to the world and turns towards the Ātmā (52)', ' When, through\\nSelf-knowledge, one gets established in the peaceful Ātmā, he attains\\nliberation (53).\\nNow, Arjuna becomes curious to know the characteristics of a\\nperson who is firmly established in Self-knowledge ( sthitaprajña) (54).\\nKṛṣṇa answers Arjuna’s question and gives the means of stabilizing the\\nknowledge.\\nKnowledge cannot be fruitful unless it is stabilized and assimi-\\nlated. For this, Kṛṣṇa talks about two important sādhana s (58 to 68)', '\\nThey are the control of the mind and the sense organs and contempla-\\ntion upon the teaching. By this, the knowledge sets (61). On the other\\nhand, if these are not practiced, the mind and the sense organs will\\ndrag a person to the field of sense-objects and gradually pull him down\\nspiritually (62, 63).\\nTalking about the characteristics of a wise man, the Lord points\\nout that the man of Self-knowledge is always satisfied with himself and\\nconsequently, he is free from all desires (55)', ' He is independent of the\\nworld to be happy. Naturally, he is free from attachment, hatred, de-\\nsire, anger, fear, elation, depression etc.(56, 57). Though living in the\\nsame world, he enjoys a freedom and contentment which is unknown\\nto others. Thus, if the ignorant man can be said to be in darkness with\\nregards to the Ātmā , the wise man is in broad daylight of the Ātmā\\n5(69).\\nThe best comparison for the wise man’s mind is the ocean', ' The\\nocean is independently full and is unaffected by the rivers, entering or\\nnot entering, dirty or clean. Similarly, the wise man’s mind is inde-\\npendently full. It is undisturbed by the favourable and unfavourable\\nexperiences, entering or not entering (70). Kṛṣṇa concludes this topic\\nby glorifying this state as the Brāhmī-state, reaching which one does\\nnot get deluded again. He lives life as a jīvan-mukta (liberated while\\nliving) even at the far end of this journey', ' After death, he becomes one\\nwithBrahman (nirvāṇam) which is called videha-mukti .\\nThus the second chapter discusses the following four topics mainly:\\n1.Arjunaśaraṇāgati . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 to 10\\n2.Sāṅkhya-yoga . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11 to 38\\n3.Karma-yoga . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 39 to 53\\n4.Sthitaprajñatva-upāya andsthitaprajña-lakṣaṇa . . . . ', ' . 54 to 72\\nSince sāṅkhya-yoga is the main topic, this chapter is aptly called\\nSāṅkhya-yoga.\\nChapter 3\\nKarma-yoga\\nIn the second chapter, the Lord praised Self-knowledge right from the\\nbeginning (11, 21, 46) and criticized the karma-kāṇḍa of the Veda s (42\\nto 45). Thereafter, He asked Arjuna to take to karma (48). This creates\\na serious doubt in Arjuna and the third chapter begins with this doubt.\\nArjuna asks—“Oh Lord! You seem to confuse me by contradic-\\ntory statements', ' Tell me one—knowledge or karma—which will lead\\nme to Mokṣa” (1, 2).\\nBhagavān answers that there are two lifestyles called karma-yoga-\\nniṣṭhā (social life) and jñāna-yoga-niṣṭhā (secluded life). One can\\nchoose anyone of them as a householder or as a monk (3).\\n(But there is no choice between karma and knowledge. Whatever\\nlifestyle one chooses, one has to follow relevant karma for purity and\\nthen pursue knowledge to discover the freedom that is one’s true nature', '\\n6Of\\nthese two lifestyles, Kṛṣṇa gives preference to social life through-\\nout the Gītā. In the Upaniṣads we find the latter emphasized. Choice\\ndepends on the maturity of the seeker.)\\nFrom the 4th to the 7th verse, Kṛṣṇa condemns inaction and praises\\nan alert and active life. Inaction should be avoided because:\\n1. Neither purity nor knowledge can be achieved by that (4);\\n2. Desires force one to act and inaction will be a suppression (5);\\n3. A mind without occupation will be idle', ' It will brood over sense-\\npleasures. Such a hypocritical mind will soon fall (6). (Also\\nrefer II-62, 63)\\nFrom the 8th to the 20th verse (1st line), Bhagavān deals with one\\nof the most beautiful and important topics of the Gītā viz.karma-yoga.\\nHaving created the world and the intelligent human beings, the\\nLord Himself advocated (in the Vedas) the way of life which is karma-\\nyoga. By following this, material and spiritual progress can be attained\\n(10 to 14)', '\\nSince it is the teaching of the Lord, the Master of the universe\\n(Svāmī), human being has to take it as a command ( niyatam ) and obey\\nit as a servant (bhṛtya) of the Lord (8).\\nWhen we follow the teachings of the Lord, it becomes a gesture\\nof our appreciation for all the gifts and blessings that the Lord has be-\\nstowed upon us. Thus, our work becomes a worship or loving offering\\n(yajña ) to God. It purifies the mind also (9, 13)', '\\nLastly, karma-yoga is necessary to maintain the harmony of the\\nuniverse upon which we are dependent. The working of the universe\\nbeing a cyclic process, with the human beings as its important link, one\\nmust be aware of one’s responsibility (duty). Thus, karma-yoga is only\\nthe duty (kāryam) of a responsible citizen of the world. One who does\\nnot discharge it proves himself/herself to be an immature human being\\n(14 to 16).\\nThus, karma-yoga is to be pursued because:\\n1', ' It contributes to material and spiritual progress ( yoga).\\n2. It is the commandment ( niyatam) of the Master of the universe.\\n73.\\nIt is our grateful offering (yajña ) to the Lord, acknowledging His\\ngifts.\\n4. It is the only way of maintaining the harmony ( dharma ).\\n(In this chapter, Bhagavān does not talk about kāmya-karma —\\nactions to fulfill the desires. This shows that true karma-yoga does not\\ninvolve kāmya-karma', ' Hence a seeker must gradually reduce kāmya-\\nkarma, even to become a true karma-yogī.)\\nKarma-yoga ultimately leads one to liberation through the stages\\nof purity ( śuddhi), enquiry (vicāra) and knowledge ( jñānam) (17, 18).\\nKṛṣṇa concludes the topic by citing the example of Janaka who success-\\nfully pursued knowledge while remaining in karma-yoga-niṣṭhā (social\\nlife) (20, 1st line)', \"\\nFrom the 20th (2nd line) to the 29th verse, the Lord talks about\\nthe role of a wise man in the society, taking Arjuna as one. Any per-\\nson with a higher status or knowledge (śreṣṭha), can influence others\\npositively or negatively. Hence, even though Arjuna might not benefit\\nfrom this war, he has to fight as kṣaṭriya's duty and set an example to\\nothers. Else, he will be responsible for anarchy in his own time as well\\nas in the future (22 to 25)\", '\\nThus, both the wise and the ignorant should act — the former for\\nteaching others, and the latter, for purity. The only difference is that\\nthe former will be detached while the latter won’t be (27 to 29).\\nThe 30th verse summarizes karma-yoga, giving five conditions:\\n1. Keep the spiritual goal.\\n2. Offer all actions to the Lord.\\n3. Don’t be concerned about the result.\\n4. Be free from possessiveness; and\\n5. Be calm.\\nOne who follows karma-yoga reaches the goal of life and the\\nother is lost (31, 32)', \"\\nLikes and dislikes (rāga-dveṣa) born of habits (vāsanas) pull a\\nperson astray. Still, a person should not go by what he likes to do but\\nwhat he has to do (duty), even if it involves difficulties (33 to 35).\\n8As\\nan answer to Arjuna's question (36), Kṛṣṇa elaborately dis-\\ncusses the problem of kāma-krodha (rāga-dveṣa). They are the real\\nenemies of a seeker (37)\", ' Clouding the knowledge, they force a person\\nto run after endless insatiable desires and take away all the chances of\\npeace and progress (38, 39). The senses, the mind, and the intellect are\\nthe base of desires. They have to be taken care of (40, 41).\\n(Durvāsanās should be replaced by śubhavāsanās by practice.\\nFalse values should be replaced by right ones through discrimination', ')\\nOnce kāma becomes weak, one can discover the Ātmā , which is\\nbeyond the senses, the mind, and the intellect and thus destroy kāma\\nfor good (42, 43).\\nThus the third chapter discusses the following topics mainly:\\n1.

These two yogas are not newly intro-\\nduced by Kṛṣṇa', ' It has been initiated by the Lord in the beginning\\nof the creation itself through the karma-kāṇḍa andjñāna-kāṇḍa of the\\nVedas. Thus, this is an ancient wisdom which has stood the test of\\ntime.)\\nKṛṣṇa begins the fourth chapter by referring to the above aspect\\nso that Arjuna will have reverence for Gītā. The Lord points out that\\nHe initiated the lineage of Vivasvān (Lord Sun), Manu, Ikṣvāku, and\\n9others\\nin the beginning of the creation (through the Vedas)', ' It is the\\nsame ancient vedic wisdom which is being revived by Lord Kṛṣṇa\\nthrough Arjuna in the form of the Gītā because it had declined by that\\ntime (2, 3).\\nNow, Arjuna wonders how Kṛṣṇa, who is his contemporary, can\\nbe the initiator of the ancient vedic wisdom (4). As an answer to this\\nquestion, Kṛṣṇa introduces the topic of avatāra (5 to 8). [We are born\\nbecause of our own karma (vyaṣṭi-karma) as well as the total karma of\\nthe world ( samaṣṭi-karma)', ' In the case of the Lord, His own karma is\\nnot there. Thus the karma of the world becomes the cause for the birth\\nof the Lord.] The evil actions of the wicked and the noble worship of\\nthe saints necessitates the manifestation ( avatāra ) of the Lord to pun-\\nish the former and bless the latter. Thus the Lord establishes dharma\\nin the universe (7, 8). But, since this birth is only through māyā, it is\\napparent. Hence it does not affect the true birth-less nature of the Lord\\n(6)', ' Moreover, since māyā is under the control of the Lord, His omni-\\nscience, omnipotence, etc. are not veiled. He remembers all the past\\n(5) as well as His true nature. It is from this standpoint that Kṛṣṇa says\\n“I initiated the vedic tradition.”\\nFrom the 9th to the 15th verse, the Lord talks about His true na-\\nture and its knowledge. Though the Lord seems to be active, He is free\\nfrom all activities and their results (13, 14). He is akartā andabhoktā', '\\nOne who recognizes this nature of the Lord also becomes liberated i.e.,\\nbecomes free from actions and their results (9). (This shows that the\\ntrue nature of the Lord and jīvais one and the same.) But, being in-\\nterested in the pursuit of various types of means and ends, one does\\nnot turn to this liberating knowledge (12)', ' Still, some people manage\\nto become one with the Lord by freeing the mind from attachment,\\nhatred and fear, by surrendering to the Lord, and by finally gaining\\nSelf-knowledge (10). Lord gives whatever the devotee seeks (11).\\nFrom the 16th to the 25th verse, Kṛṣṇa gives the knowledge of\\nthe nature of action and inaction and the characteristics of the person of\\nsuch a knowledge', ' Having talked about the rareness of such a knowl-\\nedge (16, 17), the Lord defines a wiseman as one who sees actionless-\\nness (of the Self) amidst the activities (of the body) as well as (the\\n10potential)\\naction in the seemingly inactive body (18).\\n(The idea is that the wise man accepts activities at the level of\\nbody because no one can expect relaxation at the body level. The very\\nprocess of life is the continuous function of the body', ' One should only\\ndiscover inner relaxation even amidst the activities by recognizing the\\ntrue ‘I’ as the actionless Self. Therefore, true and complete renuncia-\\ntion is possible only through knowledge.)\\nIn fact, the wise man never sees anything other than Brahman ,\\nthat being the truth of all (25). Whether his body is active (20) or not\\n(21), he is not affected. He is self-sufficient, contented, independent,\\nequanimous, and free from fancies, desires, expectations, attachments,\\nand jealousy', ' His actions are meant for the worship of the Lord which\\nuplifts the humanity (22, 23).\\nFrom the 25th to the 34th verse, the Lord talks about the supe-\\nriority of knowledge over all the other sādhanas and the way of get-\\nting that knowledge. Various sādhanas are compared to yajña s. They\\nare:Brahmajñāna-yajña, deva-yajña, viṣayabhoga-yajña, dama-yajña,\\nśama-yajña, prāṇāyāma-yajña andāhāraniyama-yajña. All sādhanas\\nlead one to liberation by preparing the mind', ' But, being the direct\\nmeans to liberation, Brahmajñāna-yajña is superior to all (33). To get\\nthis knowledge one should approach a guru who is established in the\\nTruth (Tattva-darśi ) and who has the necessary language to commu-\\nnicate it (jñānī ). Such a teacher must be approached with humility,\\nfaith, and reverence and asked for this knowledge. Instructed by them\\nthrough the scriptures, one gains knowledge; not otherwise (34)', '\\nFrom the 35th to the 37th verse, Kṛṣṇa talks about the benefit of\\nthis knowledge. Gaining the knowledge, one will not get into delusion\\nonce again. For, he sees everything in the Lord as well as in him ( i.e., he\\nrecognizes his identity with the Lord) (35). By this boat of knowledge\\none crosses over the ocean of sin however vast it may be (36). Like a\\nblazing fire, this knowledge reduces to ashes (renders inoperative) all\\nthekarmas (37). Hence, knowledge is the greatest purifier', ' (All other\\nsādhanas can produce puṇya which itself is a bondage. Moreover, no\\nother sādhana can destroy ignorance which is the root cause of all sins.)\\nThat seeker who has purified the mind will soon attain knowledge by\\n11the\\nteaching of a guru (38).\\nIn the concluding verses (38 to 42), Bhagavān talks about the\\nqualifications and disqualifications with regard to Self-knowledge', ' One\\nwho has faith in the guru and the śāstra, sense-control, and a sincere\\ndesire for knowledge will gain the knowledge (39). On the other hand,\\none who is ignorant, faithless, and doubting is doomed. He cannot en-\\njoy anything in the here or in the hereafter (40). Therefore, “ Arjuna !\\nEliminate all doubts regarding the validity of these spiritual pursuits,\\nand resort to karmayoga”, advises Lord Kṛṣṇa (42)', '\\nKarmas do not bind one who is ultimately established in the doubt-\\nless knowledge of the Self (41). This is freedom through knowledge in\\nspite of action — jñānakarmasannyāsa.\\nThe topics of this chapter are:\\n1.Gītā-stuti andavatāra . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 to 8\\n2.

He referred to the wiseman as one whose karmas are burnt by the\\nfire of knowledge (IV-19). He glorified the wiseman as one who is free\\nfrom possessions, whose only activity is the maintenance of the body\\n12(IV\\n-21), and who is happy with anything that comes due to prārabdha-\\nkarma (IV-22). Evidently, these are the signs of a monk', ' At the same\\ntime, Kṛṣṇa concludes the chapter by advising Arjuna to take to action\\n(IV-42). Naturally, Arjuna is not able to reconcile Kṛṣṇa’s various\\nstatements.\\n(In fact, secluded life and active life are only two lifestyles. The\\nfirst is called āśrama-sannyāsa [sānkhya, in this chapter] and the latter\\nis called karma-yoga [yoga , in this chapter]. In both the lifestyles, one is\\nidentified with the equipments. He is a kartā, and hence a saṃsārī', ' This\\nshows that lifestyle itself cannot give liberation. When Self-knowledge\\nis gained, one discovers that he is akartā, abhoktā and hence asaṃsārī.\\nThus, the renunciation of body-identification is true sannyāsa which\\nis called jñānakarma-sannyāsa. This sannyāsa can coexist with active\\nlife because it is mental renunciation. But āśrama-sannyāsa cannot co-\\nexist with active life because it is physical renunciation', ' Kṛṣṇa is advis-\\ningArjuna to remain in the society and attain the goal of jñānakarma-\\nsannyāsa. But Arjuna mistakes the sannyāsa asāśrama-sannyāsa and\\nsees contradiction in Kṛṣṇa’s teaching.)\\nSo the chapter begins with Arjuna’s doubt as to how a person can\\nremain in duty and be free from actions at the same time (1). Kṛṣṇa in-\\ntroduces the two lifestyles once again (it was discussed in III-3) and\\nsays that either of the lifestyles can help a person in getting mokṣa\\n(through knowledge)', ' What is necessary in both lifestyles is a rela-\\ntive freedom from rāga anddveṣa which is an important condition for\\nSelf-knowledge. Of these two, Kṛṣṇa recommends active life as ideal\\nfor a common man. As the Lord Himself points out, a secluded life is\\ndifficult to pursue without maturity (2 to 6).\\nIn the next six verses, the Lord talks about karmayoga and the\\nstages of progress. A karmayogī dedicates all his physical and men-\\ntal actions to the Lord without concern for the result', ' Because of this\\nattitude, the results do not cause any reactions in his mind. Grad-\\nually, he develops self-control and ultimately discovers his true na-\\nture which is the same in all beings. (Of course, this is accomplished\\nthrough the teaching of a guru alone.) This is called jñānakarma-\\nsannyāsa (7 to 12).\\n13In\\nthe following verses (13 to 21), Kṛṣṇa discussed the charac-\\nteristics of a wiseman and his wisdom', ' Since he has discovered his\\nidentity with the pure Self, his nature is the same as that of the Self.\\nIn His presence all the organs function. Neither does He act nor does\\nHe instigate anyone. According to their nature, the organs act and reap\\nresults. He is beyond good and evil results.\\nStill, because of ignorance, one is deluded (15). When Self-\\nignorance is destroyed by Self-knowledge, Brahman , which is the true\\nnature, becomes evident (16)', '\\nBeing spontaneously established in Brahman through the pur-\\nsuit of śravaṇam, mananam, and nididhyāsanam , these wisemen revel\\nonly in Brahman. Thus, freed from all impurities, they attain vide-\\nhamukti from where there is no return (17). They recognize the one\\nhomogeneous awareness-existence which is behind all beings as their\\nsubstratum (18). Thus, having discovered the identity with the de-\\nfectless, ever-unaffected Brahman , they overcome mortality here itself\\n(19)', ' Though prārabdha brings favorable and unfavorable situations,\\nthese spontaneous, delusion-free wisemen are neither elated nor de-\\npressed (20). Detached from the world and established in Brahman,\\nthey enjoy infinite ānanda (21).\\nIn the next two verses, the qualification of vairāgyam is stressed.\\nUnless a seeker gets detached from sensual pleasures, he cannot at-\\ntain infinite ānanda', ' A discriminative seeker who knows the imper-\\nmanence of these contact-born pleasures will not indulge in them (22).\\nAnd, one who can restrain the impulse of kāma (desire) and krodha\\n(anger) alone is a man of self-control fit to enjoy life (23).\\nNow (24 to 26) the Lord talks about videhamukti. Jīvanmuktās\\nwho revel in themselves, who are pure-minded, who love all beings,\\nand who have doubtless knowledge of the Ātmā attain oneness with\\nBrahman (videhamukti) at the fall of the body', '\\nHaving clarified Arjuna’s doubt, Kṛṣṇa gives a brief reference to\\nmeditation in the last three verses which will be discussed elaborately\\nin the next chapter.\\n(Though doubtless knowledge can be attained by śravaṇam, and\\nmananam, the habitual notion that “I am the body” does not allow the\\n14knowledge\\nto manifest as joy. Hence one has to assimilate this teaching\\nby dwelling upon it, which is called nididhyāsanam)', '\\nHaving removed all (thoughts of) sense objects, having with-\\ndrawn the sense organs, having regulated the breathing, and freed from\\ndesire, fear, and anger, one should meditate with a desire for mokṣa.\\nSuch a yogī (meditator) becomes liberated forever (27, 28).\\nKnowing the Lord who is the receiver of all sacrifices, who is\\nthe supreme Lord of all worlds, and who is the friend of all beings the\\nwiseman attains peace (29).\\nThe topics of this chapter are:\\n1.

Being an important topic, Kṛṣṇa spends almost the whole\\nof this chapter dealing with meditation. [Here, meditation is upon the\\nLord as the very Self (Ātmā) of the meditator. This is meant to assim-\\nilate the Self-knowledge gained from the guru’s teaching', ' The con-\\nditioning that “I am the body” will go only with the assimilation of\\nthe Self-knowledge. Assimilated Self-knowledge alone can express as\\nānanda.]\\nKṛṣṇa talks about five important topics on meditation. They are:\\n151.Bahiraṅga-sādhanā —\\nThose disciplines to be followed through-\\nout daily life which influence one’s meditation.\\n2.Antaraṅga-sādhanā — Those disciplines to be followed imme-\\ndiately before meditation.\\n3.Dhyāna-svarūpam — Nature of meditation.\\n4', 'Dhyāna-phalam — Result of meditation.\\n5.Dhyāna-pratibandha-parihārau — Obstacle and remedy.\\nBahiraṅga-sādhanā\\nAt the outset, the Lord indicates the role of karmayoga in meditation by\\npraising the karmayogī (1, 2). Karmayoga, being a conscious way of\\nlife, helps one in getting self-control. It converts an extrovert mind into\\na contemplative mind. Once this is achieved, one should try to lead a\\nquieter life, because active life becomes an obstacle to meditation (3)', '\\nTotal detachment is the characteristic of a contemplative mind (4).\\nIncidentally, Kṛṣṇa highlights two important values viz. self-\\nconfidence and self-control. One who lacks these two finds himself\\nto be an obstacle for any pursuit. On the other hand, one who enjoys\\nthe above two virtues finds himself to be supporting force in every field\\n(5, 6). Soon he is established in the vision of the Ātmā, the vision of\\nequality (7 to 9)', '\\nKṛṣṇa mentions a few other disciplines also, like moderation in\\neating, sleeping, working, and resting (16, 17).\\nAntaraṅga-sādhanā\\nThe meditator has to choose a secluded, undisturbed place for medi-\\ntation (10). In that spiritually and physically pure place, he has to fix\\nthe seat which is neither too high nor too low, neither too soft nor too\\nhard (11). Holding the body, neck, and head erect, he has to fix the\\nsight on the tip of his nose, as it were (i.e., the eyes are half-closed)\\n(13)', ' Next, the meditator should withdraw the mind and sense organs\\nfrom all other activities. The breathing also should be maintained even\\n16(refer\\nV-27). With a calm, withdrawn, undisturbed, tension-free, and\\none-pointed mind, the meditator should meditate upon the Lord, the\\nĀtmā (12, 14).\\nDhyāna-svarūpam andPhalam\\nMeditation is nothing but abidance of the withdrawn mind in the Ātmā\\n(18)', ' Having given up all desires and having restrained the senses\\nthrough the mind, one should gradually bring back the mind with the\\nhelp of the discriminative intellect, step by step. Once the mind is made\\nto abide in the Ātmā, there should be no other thought (25). Though the\\nmind may get distracted, one has to bring it back from the respective\\nfields to one’s own Ātmā (26).\\n(All this presupposes a clear understanding of Vedānta', ' Every-\\nthing, including thoughts, is an object of the Ātmā, the Awareness. The\\nĀtmā is not an object for me to be thought of, or to be experienced. It\\nis the very “I”. Thus, to knock off all expectations and struggles and\\nto abide as the Ātmā with the knowledge that “I am the Ātmā” is true\\nmeditation.)\\nThus, constantly abiding in the Ātmā , the meditator comes to en-\\njoy permanent peace which culminates in the attainment of liberation\\n(videhamukti) (15)', ' He enjoys an ever-abiding mind which is com-\\npletely satisfied with the discovery of the Ātmā (20). Since his ānanda\\nis not sensual, it transcends all the limits. Having discovered this inner\\nfullness, he never loses sight of his true nature (21, 27, 28). Neither\\ndoes he consider any other gain to be superior, nor is he shaken by\\neven the greatest loss (22). This infinite ānanda will never be lost be-\\ncause this was never gained. It was veiled by the false notion that “I am\\nsorrowful”', ' Once this is removed, the inner ānanda becomes evident.\\nThus, this is more a dissociation from sorrow rather than association\\n(23). (This alone is known as jīvanmukti.) Seeing the Ātmā in all be-\\nings, and all beings in the Ātmā, he gets estabilshed in the vision of\\nequality (29). This vision of the Ātmā alone is the vision of the Lord,\\nbecause the Ātmā is not different from the Lord. Thus the meditator\\nis ever established in the Lord inspite of his activities (30, 31)', ' Being\\n17established\\nin the Ātmā , he looks at all bodies including his body with\\nthe same attitude of detachment. Hence he is free from selfishness and\\nis spontaneously established in dharma. He is a saint (32).\\nDhyāna-pratibandha-parihārau\\nNow, Arjuna puts a question regarding an obstacle to meditation. It is\\nthe problem of mental restlessness or extrovertedness. Because of this,\\none finds it difficult to meditate and assimilate the Self-knowledge', '\\nThis frustrates Arjuna’s mind and he asks for a solution (33, 34).\\nKṛṣṇa gives two methods to solve this problem. They are de-\\ntachment and practice. When the mind is extrovert because of desires,\\none has to remove it by seeing the futility of desires and their fulfill-\\nment. This is detachment. Even a detached mind can be restless be-\\ncause of past habits. This has to be gradually removed by consistent\\npractice alone. Thus, mental discipline requires determination and pa-\\ntience (35, 36)', '\\nStill, Arjuna feels diffident and he, somehow, thinks that liber-\\nation is not possible in one life. He desperately asks Kṛṣṇa—“What\\nhappens to that seeker who has fallen from meditation? Does he not\\nperish like a scattered cloud?” ( Arjuna feels that the meditator has no\\npuṇya , because he has not done any karma. He has failed to achieve\\nliberation also. Thus being deceived of puṇya andmokṣa, he must face\\nan unfortunate future, according to Arjuna', ') Not being able to accept\\nthis,Arjuna surrenders to Kṛṣṇa seeking clarification (37 to 39).\\nKṛṣṇa consoles Arjuna by asserting that a spiritual seeker can\\nnever have a bad lot (40). The very meditation is a puṇyakarma capable\\nof giving heaven and later an ideal birth for the continuation of the\\nspiritual pursuit. The yogabhraṣṭa (one who has fallen from the path of\\nspirituality) is reborn in a cultured, prosperous family, or may be, even\\nin the family of a saint (41, 42)', '\\nHaving got such a birth, he gets associated with the previous\\nwisdom at a very early age (43). Irresistibly drawn by the past habits\\n(saṃskāras), he find his spiritual urge suddenly growing from a small\\nflame to a huge conflagration (44). Committing his entire life to the\\n18spiritual\\npursuit and supported by the saṃskāras of all the previous\\nlives, he effortlessly fulfils his mission in life (45)', '\\nKṛṣṇa concludes this chapter by praising the meditator in general\\n(46) and praising the meditator of Kṛṣṇa- paramātmā (Brahmātman) in\\nparticular.\\nThus the sixth chapter discusses the following topics:\\n1.Bahiraṅga-sādhanā . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 to 9, 16, 17\\n2.Antaraṅga-sādhanā . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 to 15\\n3.Dhyāna-svarūpam anddhyāna-phalam . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18 to 32\\n4.Dhyāna-pratibandha andparihāra . . . . . .

It will be the grace of the god that will be\\nemphasized hereafter. In short, all these are necessary to achieve the\\ngoal of liberation.]\\nIn the first three verses, Kṛṣṇa introduces the topic and its glory', '\\nSurrendering to God, whoever worships Him along with His attributes\\nwill ultimately discover the attribute-less God (1). The knowledge of\\nGod with attributes, as different from oneself is called jñānam, and the\\nknowledge of God as identical with oneself is called vijñānam. This is\\nthe highest knowledge because, the intellectual quest of a person finds\\nits fulfillment in this knowledge (2)', ' The very fact that the number\\n19of\\npeople who attempt and succeed in gaining this knowledge is very\\nsmall shows the subtlety and rarity of this knowledge (3).\\nFrom the 4th to the 11th verse, Kṛṣṇa talks about the nature of\\nGod. God has two aspects known as the highest nature (parā-prakṛti)\\nand the lower nature (aparā-prakṛti). The lower nature has eight di-\\nvisions — five subtle elements, cosmic ego, cosmic intellect, and the\\nunmanifest (4)', ' [This is called lower because it is changing, inert, finite\\nand dependently existent.] The higher nature is the consciousness be-\\nhind every body and that alone sustains the entire creation (5). [This is\\ncalled higher because it is changeless, conscious, infinite and indepen-\\ndently existent.] From this God alone comes the entire creation which\\nconsists of conscious and inert aspects ( jīvaandjagat). He alone sus-\\ntains the creation and resolves it (6)', ' In fact there is no creation from\\nHim and He alone is the very essence of everything (7 to 11). Being\\nthe material cause of everything, God is independent of everything and\\neverything is dependent on Him (12).\\nIn the 13th verse, the Lord traces the causes of all problems ( saṃsāra).\\nBeing deluded by the creation which is the product of three guṇas (of\\naparā-prakṛti) one fails to know the higher nature ( parā-prakṛti) of the\\nLord', '\\nThe divine māyā (power of delusion) consisting of three guṇas\\ncannot be conquered by anyone by one’s own effort. Hence the Lord\\ngives the only solution possible — “only those who surrender to me\\ncross over this māyā” (14).\\nIn the next two verses, Kṛṣṇa divides the entire humanity into five\\ngroups. The lowliest of those are those non-believers who do not accept\\nor pursue the Lord. Leading a life governed by their own desires and\\ntaking to devilish nature, such people are completely lost in māyā', ' The\\nothers, though they are devotees, worship Lord with different attitudes\\ndue to different levels of maturity. Thus ārta is one who worships the\\nLord when he is in distress. Arthārthī is one who worships the Lord for\\nmaterial prosperity. Jijñāsu, who is discriminative enough to discern\\nthe limitation of everything else, seeks the Lord through knowledge.\\nJñānī is one who has reached the destination of his life’s journey by\\ndiscovering his identity with the Lord (15, 16)', '\\n20In\\nthe next three verses, the Lord talks about the superiority of\\nthe wise-devotee. His devotion is permanent and undivided. He loves\\nthe Lord has himself because he does not have the dualistic notion.\\nNaturally, the Lord also loves the devotee as Himself (17). Then the\\nLord promises the highest goal for the wise man of non-dualistic vision\\n[because fullness is possible only in non-duality] (18)', ' Such a vision\\nis achieved by preparing oneself through many births and rare those\\nblessed ones (19).\\nIn the following four verses, the Lord talks about other devotees\\nwho worship the Lord but seek various ephemeral ends. They look\\nupon the Lord as the bestower of health, wealth, power, etc., and they\\nseek those ends through rituals and vows (20). Still the Lord, out of\\ncompassion, fulfills their prayers (21, 22). But the Lord warns that\\neverything except God is finite (23)', '\\nThen the Lord reveals His true nature [which is identical with\\nthe seeker’s nature and which is to be gained in terms of knowledge].\\nHe is ever evident, imperishable, unsurpassed (24) and unborn. Still\\npeople, deluded by māyā, mistake the Lord as the person subject to\\nbirth, etc. (25). Being of the nature of one non-dual awareness, God\\nalone knows everything belonging to the past, present and future. God\\nnever becomes the object of knowledge (26)', '\\nConcluding this topic, Kṛṣṇa mentions the stages of devotion.\\nBecause of the fundamental self-ignorance no one can avoid desires in\\nthe initial stages of life. Naturally he will be ārta andarthārthī (27).\\nWhen he worships the Lord, his mind becomes purified and slowly\\ndesires become less. He becomes a jijñāsu (28). Now, his attention\\nturns towards knowledge and he pursues it, surrendering to the Lord', '\\nSoon he becomes jñānī knowing all about Brahman ,karma, adhyātma,\\nadhibūta, adhidaiva andadhiyajña. [He knows both the parā-prakṛti\\nandaparā-prakṛti of the Lord.] Being established in his knowledge, he\\ndoes not lose sight of the Lord even at the time of death (29, 30).

Adhiya-\\njñais the Lord as the presiding deity of all the actions of the individ-\\nual (4).\\nFrom the 5th verse till the end of this chapter, Lord Kṛṣṇa elab-\\norately answers the last question i.e., how to remember the Lord even\\nat the time of death', '\\n22Whatever\\nbe the predominant thought-pattern at the time of death,\\nthat determines the place of the rebirth as well as the type of rebirth (6).\\nHence, if a person yearns for the Lord at the time of death, his rebirth\\nwill be conducive for the pursuit of the Lord in which he will naturally\\nbe successful (5). [It is said that those who are saguṇa-upāsakas will\\ngo to Brahmaloka. They will attain liberation by gaining knowledge\\nfrom Brahmā, the creator himself. This is called krama-mukti]', ' But\\nthe thought pattern at the time of the death is determined by the pre-\\ndominant thought pattern throughout one’s life. Hence, Kṛṣṇa asks to\\nremember God all the time so that we will remember Him at the time\\nof death also (7). Though it may appear difficult, one can succeed in\\nthis by constant effort and sincere practice (8).\\nFrom the 9th to the 13th verse, Kṛṣṇa describes elaborately the\\npractice of upāsanā at the time of death. One should control the organs\\nof perception as well as action', ' Then by the skill of yoga-practice,\\nprāṇa has to be withdrawn (through the suṣumnā-nāḍī) to the top of\\nthe head between the eyebrows. Then, he should withdraw the mind\\nback to the heart, its source. With such a mind he should meditate on\\noṅkāra or any chosen deity with all devotion. He attains God who is\\nomniscient, eternal, the ruler, subtler than the subtlest, the sustainer\\nof all, incomprehensible, effulgent, and beyond ignorance. All scrip-\\ntures talk about Him alone', ' All dispassionate seekers reach Him alone.\\nAll disciplines are for attaining Him alone. He is the ultimate goal of\\nupāsakas.\\nFor a person who is sincerely committed to the practice of me-\\ndiation of God and whose devotion is undivided, God is easily attain-\\nable (14).\\nThen the Lord compares two types of goals, i.e., God and the\\nworld. Nobody can put the end to the cycle of birth by reaching higher\\nlokas (worlds) or by acquiring better bodies', ' Even Brahmā, the creator,\\nwho has the longest duration of life (his day being two thousand catur-\\nyugas) cannot be free from finitude. Then what to talk of all other\\nthings and beings which appear during the day of Brahmā and disap-\\npear during his night? Hence all the lokas and achievements therein are\\nfinite. God is the only eternal and changeless principle who is beyond\\n23the\\nunmanifest and manifest creation. He is imperishable and is the\\nsupreme goal of life', ' All beings exist in Him and everything is per-\\nvaded by Him. Attaining Him, one does not take rebirth in the mortal\\nworld ( saṃsāra) (15 to 22).\\nThus the Lord established that attainment of God is the highest\\ngoal compared to all other achievements. Now Kṛṣṇa discusses the\\ntwo paths that lead to the two goals which are subject to non-return\\nand return', ' An upāsaka attains krama-mukti by departing through the\\nbright-path (śukla-gati) which is presided over by the deities of fire,\\nday, bright-fortnight and uttarāyaṇam. (He goes to Brahmaloka, gains\\nSelf-knowledge from Brahmā and becomes liberated.) Ritualists go\\nby the dark-path (kṛṣṇa-gati) which is presided over by the deities of\\nsmoke, night, dark-fortnight and dakṣiṇāyanam. They come back after\\nenjoying in the heavens (23 to 26)', '\\nSince the bright path takes one to God, one should choose that\\nalone. To take to that path one should become an upāsaka. Hence\\nKṛṣṇa advises Arjuna to be committed to upāsanā (27).\\nConcluding the topic, Kṛṣṇa glorifies the result of upāsanā as\\nsuperior to all other results gained through all other pursuits. Because,\\nnone of them can take one to that goal which the Upasaka attains —\\nthe supreme, primal God.\\n(Upāsanā can take a seeker to Guru andśāstra. Naturally up-\\nāsaka becomes jñāni-bhakta', ' He is liberated in this very life. He has\\nno travel. This aspect ( jīvanmukti) was talked in the seventh chapter\\nand will be continued from the ninth chapter.\\nIfupāsanā does not take one to guru andśāstra, he continues to\\nbe self-ignorant. He is not liberated in this life. But he travels by the\\nbright-path to Brahmaloka. Instructed by Brahmā, the creator himself,\\nhe becomes jñāni-bhakta and is liberated. This is called krama-mukti,\\nwhich is discussed in the eighth chapter', '\\nThus upāsanā is useful for jīvanmukti as well as krama-mukti.)\\nThe main topics discussed in this chapter are:\\n1.

The aim of\\nthe Lord is not to teach saguṇa-upāsanā as a means for krama-mukti.\\nThe main purpose of upāsanā is to qualify oneself to know the true\\nnature of the Lord and attain liberation in this life itself ( jīvanmukti).\\nThus, the Lord wants to teach upāsanā mainly as a preparatory step to\\nknowledge. This was done in the seventh chapter. Kṛṣṇa brings out\\nthis idea in this chapter also', ']\\nIn the first three verses, Kṛṣṇa introduces the topic, its glory, and\\nthe qualifications needed for its pursuit. The topic is the knowledge\\nof god in both the saguṇa and the nirguṇa forms ( jñāna andvijñāna).\\nIt is the most secret and sacred knowledge which releases one from\\nbondage. It is the easiest and immediate in giving the result. The seeker\\nshould have faith in the teacher and the teaching if the pursuit should\\nbe fruitful', '\\nIn the next three verses (4 to 6), the Lord reveals His true nature.\\nHe pervades the entire universe. Still, He is not related to anything.\\nIn fact, there is no universe other than God. Yet, it appears because of\\nHismāyā. He is ever non-dual and relationless like space ( kevala and\\nasaṅga).\\n25Then Kṛṣṇa comes\\ndown and redefines Himself accepting the\\nuniverse (7 to 10). He is the basis for the origin, existence, and dis-\\nsolution of the entire universe ( jagat-kāraṇam)', ' Blessed by God, His\\nprakṛti which is inseparable from Him, keeps the cycle of creation go-\\ning. Though the Lord’s presence is inevitable for all these phenomena,\\nHe is not involved in any one of them as doer or enjoyer. He is akartā\\nandabhoktā.\\nIn the 11th verse, Kṛṣṇa talks about the cause of bondage. Be-\\ncause of the fundamental ignorance, no one knows the nature of God.\\nConsequently, He is mistaken for human being with birth, form, etc', '\\n(Thus it is due to ignorance and consequent delusion regarding the na-\\nture of God — and oneself — that one gets bound).\\nThough ignorance is universal, many do not accept the fact. Hence,\\nthey never attempt to get rid of it. Believing neither in the scriptures nor\\nin the established traditions, these atheists take to evil ways as directed\\nby their instincts and waste their precious life (12)', '\\nOn the other hand, there are some noble people who clearly rec-\\nognize their bondage and worship the Lord, seeking Him alone to get\\nout of the bondage (13, 14). Kṛṣṇa points out here that various devo-\\ntees worship Him in manifold ways. Some worship God as identical\\nwith themselves, some as different from themselves, and some as ev-\\nerything (15). In this context, the Lord describes His cosmic form i.e.,\\nviśvatomukhatvam (16 to 19)', '\\nIn the next three verses, Bhagavān talks about two types of devo-\\ntees — those who seek various finite ends through Him ( sakāma-bhakta s)\\nand those who seek the infinite God only ( niṣkāma- bhakatas). The\\nLord points out that the worship for finite ends will be definitely fruit-\\nful. But, being finite they cannot last long. Even the attainment of\\nheavens is finite only. A niṣkāma-bhakta worships God seeking noth-\\ning else', ' The Lord promises to take care of even the worldly well-being\\nof such a bhakta because he has renounced all his worldly pursuits (22).\\nFrom verse 23rd to 29th, the Lord stresses the point that whether\\none should continue in saṃsāra (bondage) or attain mokṣa (liberation)\\nis one’s own choice (puruśārtha). When people seek finite goals through\\nthe worship of other deities, they are invoking the finite aspects of that\\n26one\\ninfinite God alone (23). All their prayers go to that one God only', '\\n(The amount of water that we can fetch from the ocean depends on\\nwhat vessel we take.) Thus, they miss the infinite due to ignorance\\n(24). Though the Lord is capable of giving everything, He can give\\nonly what the devotee is willing to receive. Hence, the Lord says that\\none gets what one seeks (25). What type of worship one must do to\\nattain the infinite? Bhagavān says that the worship is the simplest for a\\nniṣkāma-bhakta. He can offer anything. The attitude is important (26)', '\\nEven if that is not possible, one should convert every action into wor-\\nship by (mentally) offering it at the feet of the Lord (27). Such a bhakta\\nis akarma-yogī (because he continues to act with equanimity) as well\\nas asannyāsī (because he renounces the concern for the results). He be-\\ncomes purified and liberated soon by getting the teaching of scriptures\\nthrough a guru (28). Kṛṣṇa concludes this topic by reemphasizing that\\nHe is available to all. It is for us to claim Him or not (29)', '\\nIn the last five verses Kṛṣṇa glorifies bhakti. The greatness of\\nbhakti is that even those who are not qualified for self-knowledge be-\\ncause of their past sins, weaknesses, extrovertedness, or dullness can\\ntake to bhakti and achieve the goal. Thus, bhakti is universal. The\\ndevotee will never perish. In conclusion, Kṛṣṇa sums up the pursuit\\nofBhakti thus — “Fix your mind on Me; be My devotee; keep Me as\\nyour goal; be My worshiper; surrender to Me', ' Thus fixing the mind,\\nyou will attain Me alone who am the Self.”\\n(Here, we should note that bhakti — whether it is taken as con-\\nstant love of God or meditation on saguṇa-īśvara, cannot directly take\\none to the goal. It can take one to a guru only. One has to gain Self-\\nknowledge by the study of scriptures under a guru. This alone can lead\\none directly to liberation.)\\nThe main topics of this chapter are:\\n1. Introduction to the knowledge, its glory and necessary qualifica-\\ntions . . . . . . .

Since the effect cannot be different from\\nthe material cause, it clearly follows that the universe cannot be differ-\\nent from God', ' Thus the entire universe is the divine manifestation of\\nGod. Hence whatever glories we see in the creation belong to the Lord\\nalone. Kṛṣṇa reveals this idea in this chapter as the culmination of his\\nteaching of Virāṭ (Viśvarūpam).]\\nIn the first three verses, Kṛṣṇa introduces the topic of vibhūti and\\nyoga —vibhūti is the manifestation of Lord and yoga is the power of\\nmanifestation. Even great sages cannot talk about the glories of the\\nLord, because they are finite beings born later', ' Hence it is the rarest\\nknowledge that is given. One who gains this knowledge will be free\\nfrom saṃsāra (1 to 3).\\nIn the next four verses, the Lord reveals His glory by pointing out\\nthat the entire subtle universe of thoughts as well as the gross universe\\nare born of Him. The seven great sages, the four sages Sanaka etc., and\\ntheManus are all born of the mind of the Lord. One who knows this\\nattains self-knowledge ultimately (4 to 7)', '\\nThe following four verses deal with the Virāṭ-devotees and the\\nbenefits of such a devotion. The devotees accept everything as a gift\\nof God, because God is the source of all. They think about God, speak\\nabout God, hear about God — in short they spend their lives revelling\\nin God all the time (8, 9). (Still they are saguṇa-devotees only. They\\nare ignorant of the highest nature of the Lord.) The Lord says that He\\n28takes\\nthe responsibility of enlightening them', ' Out of compassion for\\nthem, the Lord lights up the lamp of knowledge, remaining in their\\nheart. (The idea is that the Lord will provide them with a guru and the\\nnecessary conditions for the knowledge of the highest nature of God.)\\n(10, 11)\\nIn the next seven verses (12 to 18), Arjuna requests Kṛṣṇa to\\ngive the details of His glories (manifestations) which will help him\\ninupāsanā. (Each expression of God in the universe can become a\\nsymbol for upāsanā', ' Later, when see every glory as the expression of\\nGod, it becomes the appreciation of Virāṭ. This helps in the expansion\\nof the mind.]\\nFrom verse 19th to the end of the chapter, Bhagavān describes\\nHis glories. The Lord is careful to add both in the beginning and in the\\nend that it is not an exhaustive list of His glories. They are the impor-\\ntant ones. Nobody can exhaust the glories of the Lord (19, 40). Kṛṣṇa\\nbegins the enumeration with the very Self', ' The best, the closest and\\nthe most evident expression of the Lord is the very ‘I’, the conscious-\\nness (20). Kṛṣṇa concludes the list by pointing out that He is the very\\nexistence in all beings, because He is the material cause ( bījam) of all\\n(39). In short, whatever there is which is glorious, rich or powerful —\\nall of them are the expressions of only a ray of God’s glory (41)', ' In\\nfact it is not that the Lord’s glory is in the world, but the entire world\\nis in the Lord, occupying a part of Him, as it were (42). (The world\\ncannot be a part of the Lord in the real sense of the term, because it is\\nonly apparent as the Lord Himself negates it in IX-5.)\\nThe main topics of this chapter are:\\n1.

Now, in this chapter, Arjuna appreciates\\nthis teaching and sees the universe as the very Lord', ')\\nIn the first two verses, Arjuna summarizes the entire teaching\\nofKṛṣṇa – the nature of jīva(predominantly discussed in the first six\\nchapters) and the nature of God (predominantly discussed in the later\\nfour chapters). Though Arjuna has received the teaching, he is unable\\nto appreciate the universal form due to some mental blocks. Hence, he\\nprays to the Lord for the vision of the universal form of the Lord (3, 4)', '\\nLord Kṛṣṇa agrees to bless Arjuna with the vision of the univer-\\nsal form (5 to 7). Since this is not possible to have such a vision with\\nthe ordinary eyes, Kṛṣṇa grants Arjuna the divine eye for this special\\npurpose (8). (Universal form is not a special form of the Lord. It is the\\nLord as the universe. As such, it is available for all at all times. The\\nLord need not show it. Still we miss it because of our narrow outlook\\nof the world', ' Once we refine our mind and look at the universe, we\\ncannot miss the Lord. His stamp is there in all, from a blade of grass\\nto the farthest star. Such a mind which is tuned to see the Lord is the\\ndivine eye behind the fleshy eyes. It is such an eye that Kṛṣṇa granted\\ntoArjuna.)\\nFrom the 9th to the 14th verse, we get a description of the uni-\\nversal form from Sañjaya. He picturises the Lord as a person with all\\ndivine ornaments shining with the brilliance of a thousand suns risen\\ntogether', ' (We should remember that this is a description of the world\\nonly, divinised by the change of outlook. Every exalted object in the\\ncreation should be taken as an ornament of the Lord.)\\nFrom the 15th verse, we get Arjuna’s appreciation of the uni-\\nversal form. (Arjuna goes through the various phases as he sees the\\nuniversal form. The first response is one of wonder only.) Arjuna sees\\nall beings in the cosmic body of the Lord. The sun and the moon are\\nlike his eyes. He sees the hands, legs, etc', ', of the people as those of\\n30the\\nLord. Now, the Lord’s body with thousands of hands, legs, etc.,\\nappears without beginning, middle or end (15 to 22).\\nNow Arjuna’s attention is turned towards the mouth of the Lord\\nwhich represents Time (Death). With blazing fire and protruding teeth,\\nthe Lord’s mouth evokes terror in all, including Arjuna. Arjuna sees\\nthe entire world being scorched by this fire (Time), while many are\\nrushing towards the mouth of the Lord', ' Some are already inside the\\nmouth and some are crushed between the teeth. All these cause great\\nfear and confusion in Arjuna and he begins to doubt whether the Lord\\nis a loving father or a terrible destroyer (23 to 31). (This shows that\\nArjuna is still not able to see the Lord as a whole. He is able to accept\\n‘birth’ as part of the universe, but not ‘death’. This partial outlook is\\nthe cause of fear and confusion. This is the second phase', ')\\nThen, the Lord clarifies that the fierce aspect also is Himself,\\nmanifesting as the Time-principle. When the time comes for people\\nto die, the Lord finds the instruments to bring this about and Arjuna\\nhappens to be one of them in the hands of the Lord (32 to 34). Having\\nunderstood the Lord to be ‘the cosmic-stage-manager’, Arjuna surren-\\nders to His Will and sings His glory (34-45). (Now Arjuna appreciates\\nthe Lord as totality, the basis of creation-preservation-dissolution', ' In\\nfront of the Lord everything else is insignificant. This appreciation\\nmakes him a devotee, seeking forgiveness for all his past omissions\\nand commissions. Thus, the third phases is true devotion to the Lord,\\nborn out of right understanding).\\nArjuna is indeed happy to have this unique vision of the Lord.\\nStill, one part of his mind is not able to accept the totality, especially\\nthe destructive aspect. So Arjuna requests the Lord to withdraw his\\nform (46)', '\\nIn the last nine verses (47 to 55), we see the Lord withdrawing\\nHis universal form (i.e. , the Lord takes away the divine eye that Arjuna\\nenjoyed till now. Arjuna comes down to look at the world in his own\\nprivate way.) The Lord praises devotion as a means to this cosmic\\nvision. This universal form could be seen by Arjuna because of his\\ndevotion. Through devotion one can purify the mind, see the universal\\nform, know the true nature of the Lord, and become one with the Lord', '\\n31Hence, Kṛṣṇa tellsArjuna -\\n“Do actions for My sake; be My devotee;\\nkeep Me as the ultimate goal; be detached (from the world); be free\\nfrom hatred towards all.

(In fact,\\nwe cannot compare them. Everyone has to go through both and one can\\nreach the Lord through nirguṇabhakti alone, which the Lord himself\\n32points\\nout in the 4th verse. Still the Lord praises saguṇabhakta because\\nof the context', ') (2)\\nFrom the 3rd verse to the 12th verse, Kṛṣṇa gives out the entire\\nrange of bhakti which leads to liberation. In the first 3 verses (3 to 5)\\nKṛṣṇa talks about nirguṇabhakti which is jñānayoga and which is the\\ndirect means for liberation. But, the Lord points out that this would be\\ndifficult for unprepared people (5).\\nFrom the 6th verse to the 8th verse, the Lord speaks about the\\nnext lower stage in the form of virāḍ-upāsanā', ' He promises that such\\nupāsaka would be rescued from saṃsāra by the Lord. (This does not\\nmean that a virāḍ-upāsaka can get liberation, skipping jñānayoga. The\\nidea is that he becomes fit for jñānayoga and attains liberation through\\nknowledge.)\\nIn the 9th verse, the Lord comes one more step down. If one is\\nincapable of doing virāḍ-upāsana, let him practice meditation on any\\nform of the Lord (iṣṭadevatā-upāsanā ). Thus, upāsanā (onvirāḍ or\\niṣṭadevatā) becomes the preparatory step for jñānayoga', '\\nIn the next verse (10th), the Lord comes down further. If a person\\nis too extrovert to take up upāsanā, he is asked here to perform his\\nduty (nitya andnaimittika) as an offering to the Lord ( Īśvarārpaṇam)\\nwithout expecting any reward.\\nWhen a person is full of desires, he is impelled to do desire-born\\nactions (kāmya) expecting results. For such a person Kṛṣṇa prescribes\\nthe last step', ' When he receives the result of kāmya-karmas, let him take\\nit as a prasāda (graceful gift) of the Lord and avoid reaction. Kṛṣṇa\\nindicates this through the word ‘ sarvakarmaphalatyāgam’ (11).\\nThe above two steps come under karmayoga . (Akarmayogī be-\\ncomes fit for upāsanā after some time. Upāsanā makes him qualified\\nforjñānayoga. Jñāna helps him discover his own true ever-free nature.)\\nKṛṣṇa concludes this topic by praising the last step of karma-\\nyoga (12)', '\\nFrom the 13th verse up to the 19th verse, Kṛṣṇa gives a clear\\npicture of the characteristics of one who has gone through all these\\nsteps and discovered fulfillment. [As a karmayogī andupāsaka he was\\na devotee of saguṇa-īśvara, seeing the Lord as distinct from him. This\\n33is\\nonly lower bhakti, because he does not know the true nature of the\\nLord still (Refer VII-17). His bhakti issaguṇabhakti orbhedabhakti\\noraparā-bhakti', ' Once he pursues jñānayoga and discovers his identity\\nwith the Lord, his bhakti becomes nirguṇabhakti orabhedabhakti or\\nparā-bhakti, which is an end in itself.] In these verses Kṛṣṇa describes\\nthe traits of a parabhakta who is a sthitaprajña (Refer II-55 to 72).\\n(This serves twofold purpose. Firstly, it is an inspiration for a seeker\\nto pursue his sādhanam. Secondly, the natural traits of a parabhakta\\nserve as values for a sādhaka to be deliberately practised', ')\\nThis portion can be broadly divided into two.

In the second six chapters,\\nBhagavān discussed the nature of Īśvara (tat-pada) and upāsanā pre-\\ndominantly — especially virāḍ-upāsanā. When a seeker goes through\\nthese stages of understanding and sādhanam, he becomes ready for\\njñānayoga which is the recognition of the identity between the jīvaand\\nĪśvara (asi-pada)', ' This is the topic which will be dealt with in the fol-\\nlowing six chapters.]\\nThe thirteenth chapter is presented in the form of six topics —\\nkṣetram, kṣetrajña, jñānam, jñeyam, puruṣa and prakṛti.\\n35(Though\\nthese are discussed separately, we should note that kṣe-\\ntrajña, jñeyam, and puruṣa are the same essentially. Similarly, kṣetram\\nandprakṛti are essentially the same.)\\nKṣetram\\nThe entire objective universe is kṣetram', ' From the beginningless prakṛti\\n(avyaktam) everything experienced by us comes under this. It includes\\nmahat (cosmic intellect), ahaṅkāra (cosmic ego), the subtle and gross\\nelements, sense organs of action and perception, the mind and its mod-\\nifications (6, 7). Still, Kṛṣṇa specially mentions the body as kṣetram\\n(2) because we generally do not see the body as part of the universe.\\nKṣetrajña\\nThat conscious principle which illumines the kṣetram is called kṣetra-\\njña(2)', ' Having defined kṣetrajña ,Kṛṣṇa reveals that the kṣetrajña is\\nnone other than the Lord ( i.e.Brahman ) Himself who is the conscious-\\nness in all bodies (3). Thus, kṣetrajña is one all-pervading conscious-\\nness. (This kṣetrajña alone is called jīva. So, the idea given here is the\\nessential identity of jīvaandĪśvara.)\\nJñānam\\nFrom the 8th to the 12th verse, Kṛṣṇa talks about some important val-\\nues which prepare the mind for Self-knowledge', ' They are: humility,\\nsimplicity, non-violence, forbearance, honesty, service to the teacher,\\npurity, steadfastness, self-control, detachment from sense objects, ab-\\nsence of egoism, constant awareness of the misery in birth, death, etc.,\\ndispassion, non-identification with son, wife, house, etc', ', being always\\nequanimous in desirable and undesirable situations, unswerving devo-\\ntion to the Lord, seclusion, non-indulgence in people’s company, con-\\nstant self-enquiry, and not losing sight of the fruit of Self-knowledge.\\n36Jñeyam\\nInthe next six verses (13th to 18th), Kṛṣṇa talks about the Truth which\\nis to be known. It is beginningless, beyond satandasat (13), all-\\npervading, subtle, far (for the ignorant), and near (for the wise) (16)', '\\nThough undivided, it appears divided and it is the creator, sustainer,\\nand destroyer of all (17). It is the light of consciousness which re-\\nsides in the heart of all (18). Being subtle, it cannot be known in its\\npure form. Yet, it shines in the body (as Awareness-Existence) and in\\nthe world (as Existence). One has to recognize it as pure Awareness-\\nExistence by distinguishing it from the body and the world (14, 15).\\n(This method of teaching is called adhyāropa-apavāda-prakriyā i.e', 'the\\nmethod of superimposition and negation.)\\nHaving talked about these four topics, Kṛṣṇa glorifies this knowl-\\nedge as the one which leads the seeker to Him (19).\\nPuruṣa andPrakṛti\\nNow comes the last pair, puruṣa andprakṛti (20 to 24). Both are\\nbeginning-less. Blessed by puruṣa, prakṛti creates everything (20 and\\n27). (Though beginningless, puruṣa andprakṛti are of opposite na-\\nture. While puruṣa is conscious, changeless and real, prakṛti is inert,\\nchanging, and unreal', ') The body, the mind, and their activities belong\\ntoprakṛti, whereas puruṣa is a mere illuminator of all these (21). When\\npuruṣa obtains in the body as kṣetrajña, it seems to be a kartā, bhoktā,\\netc.But as paramātmā , the absolute, it is ever unaffected and is ever the\\nsame (23). Not knowing this, when puruṣa (i.e.kṣetrajña ) identifies\\nwith the body and its guṇas, then, all limitations and the consequent\\nproblems arise (22)', ' One who has the discriminative knowledge of\\npuruṣa andprakṛti attains immortality (24).\\nIn the following verses (25th and 35th) Kṛṣṇa sums up the teach-\\ning and presents its sādhanam andphalam. The wise man is one who\\nalways abides in the Self, which is the same everywhere (28 and 29),\\nwhich is actionless (30), and which is unaffected (32) like the space\\n(33) or like the light (34). The Self is not only the illuminator of ev-\\nerything (34) but also the substratum of the whole universe (31)', ' In\\n37fact,\\nthere is no universe other than the Self (35). One who has assim-\\nilated this wisdom is Brahman itself (31) and attains the supreme goal\\nof liberation (35).\\nTo gain this knowledge, one has to purify the mind through kar-\\nmayoga, gain knowledge through enquiry (sāṅkhya-yoga), and ulti-\\nmately get established in the knowledge through dhyānayoga (25 and\\n26).\\nThe main topics in this chapter are:\\n1.

It is the greatest knowledge which takes one to the\\ngreatest goal of liberation. By this knowledge, one attains the nature\\nof God Himself and thus becomes free from birth and death.\\nIn the next two verses, Kṛṣṇa gives a brief account of creation.\\nBlessed by the Lord (puruṣa), prakṛti gives birth to this universe. Thus,\\nthey are the universal parents from whom all things and beings origi-\\nnate', '\\n38From\\nthe 5th to the 18th verse, Bhagavān makes an elaborate\\nanalysis of the three guṇas — sattva ,rajas and tamas. They are born of\\nprakṛti and are responsible for the human bondage. The Lord analyses\\nthem from various angles which can be depicted in the form of a chart.\\nEven though all the beings have the three guṇas, they differ be-\\ncause of the predominance of one guṇa over the other two', ' (It is also\\npossible to change the proportions for which alone all the preparatory\\nsādhanās are prescribed) (10).\\nIn the 19th and 20th verses, Kṛṣṇa teaches the means of tran-\\nscending the guṇas. The Lord points out that the transcendence is in\\nthe form of knowledge alone. The Self ( puruṣa) happens to be already\\nbeyond the guṇas (guṇātīta). It is the body (prakṛti) which has guṇas,\\ndoership, etc. Because of identification with the body alone, the Self\\n(puruṣa ) seems to have guṇas', ' Hence the only solution is to discrim-\\ninate and own up the guṇātīta puruṣa as oneself (19). Through this\\nknowledge, one discovers oneself to be free from birth, death, etc.This\\nis liberation (20).\\nArjuna asksKṛṣṇa about the characteristics of a guṇātīta and the\\nsādhanā to achieve this (21).\\nFrom the 22nd to the 25th verse, Kṛṣṇa answers the first ques-\\ntion. Guṇatīta is one who is detached from prakṛti. He does not have\\nI-notion in his body or my-notion in the world', ' Hence, he looks at the\\nvariations of guṇas objectively without reacting to them (22). He re-\\nmains unaffected by the opposite experiences of life like pleasure-pain,\\npraise-censure, honour-dishonour, etc. They are the play of prakṛti\\n(23, 24). Being full, he does not seek anything and therefore is free\\nfrom selfish activities (25)', ' (Since a guṇātīta is invariably a wise man,\\nthis description tallies with the sthitaprajña portion of the 2nd chapter\\nas well as the parābhakta portion of the 12th chapter).\\nKṛṣṇa concludes by prescribing bhakti as the sādhanā to achieve\\nthis goal. (Thus, the Lord answers Arjuna’s second question. By the\\ngrace of the Lord one gets a guru. Through the guru, one gets the\\nknowledge which makes one guṇātīta)', ' A bhakta becomes fit to attain\\nBrahman’s nature ( guṇātītatvam) which is immortality and absolute\\nānanda (26, 27).\\n39No', ' T\\nopic Sattva Rajas Tamas\\n1 Lakṣaṇam\\n(Definition)Prakāśātmakam(Of\\nthe nature of bright-\\nness) (6)Rāgātmakam(Of\\nthe nature of delu-\\nsion) (7)Mohanātamakam(Of\\nthe nature of attach-\\nment) (8)\\n2 Bandhanaprakāra\\n(Mode\\nof bind-\\ning)Jñānasaṅga(By\\ncausing attachment\\nto knowledge) (6, 9)Karmasaṅga(By\\ncausing attachment\\nto activity) (7, 9)Pramādasaṅga(By\\ncausing attachment\\nto indifference) (8, 9)\\n3 Liṅgam(Sign\\nof predomi-\\nnance)Jñānavṛddhi(Increase\\nof knowl-\\nedge) (11)Karmavṛddhi(Increase\\nof activity)\\n(1', ')Pramādavṛddhi(Increase\\nof indiffer-\\nence) (13)\\n4 Gati(T\\nravel after\\ndeath)Ūrdhvagati(T\\no higher lokas)\\n(14, 18)Madhyamagati(T\\no middle lokas)\\n(15, 18)Adhogati(T\\no lower lokas)\\n(16, 18)\\n5 Phalam\\n(Consequence\\nin\\nthis life)Puṇya &Jñānam\\n(Puṇya and\\nknowl-\\nedge) (16, 17)Duḥkham &Lobha\\n(Sorrow\\nand greed)\\n(16, 17)Ajñānam &Moha\\n(Ignorance\\nand delu-\\nsion) (16, 17)\\n40The\\ntopics discussed in this chapter are:\\n1.

Being a subtle topic,\\nKṛṣṇa discusses the same in this chapter also, in a different way.]\\nIn the first two and a half verses, Kṛṣṇa gives a description of the\\nvast and endless saṃsāra by comparing it with the mighty aśvattha-\\ntree. Like this tree, this saṃsāra is vast, many-branched, well-rooted\\nand not easily destructible', ' To add to this is its mysterious nature. (The\\njīvais caught in this saṃsāra, helplessly struggling to free itself.)\\nIn the next two and half verses (upto the 5th), Bhagavān talks\\nabout the means to get out of this saṃsāra. The first step is to de-\\nvelop detachment from this saṃsāra by recognizing its binding nature.\\n(As long as one has value for worldly pursuits, one’s mind will not\\nbe available for seeking freedom', ') Having withdrawn the mind from\\nworldly desires, one should seek Brahman, the cause of everything (4).\\n(Seeking Brahman is nothing but jñānayoga — vedantic enquiry under\\naguru.) Then, Kṛṣṇa highlights the qualifications necessary for this\\nknowledge. Freedom from (reaction towards) the pairs of opposites,\\npride, delusion, and attachment as well as a commitment to vedantic\\nenquiry are emphasized here (5).\\nIn the 6th verse, the Lord talks about the nature of Brahman ', '\\nIt is not illumined by anything (because it is the self-effulgent con-\\n41sciousness\\nwhich illumines everything). Attaining this Brahman , the\\nsupreme abode of the Lord, one does not return to saṃsāra again.\\n[In the following sections, Kṛṣṇa reveals that Brahman alone ex-\\npresses in the form of jīvaandjagat (universe). From this it becomes\\nclear that reaching Brahman does not involve travel', ']\\nFrom the 7th to the 11th verse, Kṛṣṇa shows that the jīva, the con-\\nsciousness in every being, is the Lord’s (Brahman ’s) expression only\\n(7). At the time of death, this jīvaalone takes the mind and sense-\\norgans from one body to another body. (8). It is this jīvawho experi-\\nences everything through the sense organs (9). Thus, the Lord alone is\\nexpressing in the form of the very life and its functions in every being\\n(10)', ' The pure-minded ones recognize this whereas the deluded ones\\ndo not (11).\\nFrom the 12th to the 15th verse, Kṛṣṇa shows how the jagat (the\\nuniverse) also is an expression of the Lord (Brahman). The light in the\\nsun, the moon, and the fire is the Lord only (12). In the form of the\\nsunlight and moonlight, the Lord alone sustains all living beings (13).\\nAs the digestive fire, it is the Lord who digests the food (14). The Lord\\nalone is behind all the mental faculties of knowledge, memory, etc', 'He\\nis the author and the content of the Vedas as well as the knower of the\\nVeda s (15).\\n(Thus, Kṛṣṇa reveals that Brahman alone is in the form of jīva\\nandjagat. Hence reaching Brahman is in the form of understanding\\nonly — understanding that Brahman is never away from either oneself\\nor the universe.)\\nIn the next three verses, Bhagavān reveals Brahman in its true na-\\nture. Brahman, in the form of the manifest universe, is called kṣarapu-\\nruṣa', ' As the unmanifest universe (māyā), the same Brahman is called\\nakṣarapuruṣa (16). Both these puruṣas are relative. Beyond these two\\npuruṣas is the uttamapuruṣa, the absolute. Because of its superiority,\\nit is called paramātmā orpuruṣottama. It is the imperishable (attribute-\\nless)Brahman because of which everything exists (17, 18).\\nConcluding the teaching, Kṛṣṇa glorifies this knowledge as the\\nmeans of fulfillment', ' With an undeluded mind, the one who knows this\\nmost secret knowledge of puruṣottama, becomes the knower of all and\\n42a\\nperson of fulfillment (19, 20).\\nThe main topics discussed in this chapter are:\\n1.

In the following two chapters, Kṛṣṇa discusses the values to\\nbe followed by a seeker. Though values themselves do not give liber-\\nation, they are necessary to gain knowledge. They alone prepare the\\nmind and make it fit for receiving the knowledge', ' In fact, Vedānta is\\napramāṇa (means of knowledge) only for a prepared mind.\\nIn this chapter, Kṛṣṇa divides all mental traits into two groups\\n—daivī-sampat andāsurī-sampat. All sattvic traits come under the\\nformer, while rajasic and tamasic traits come under the latter. Daivī-\\nsampat is conducive to Self-knowledge; āsurī-sampat is an obstacle\\nto spiritual pursuit (5). [Without exception, every one in this universe\\nfalls under one of these two groups', ' From this it is evident that all seek-\\ners of knowledge must necessarily lead a spiritual (sattvic) life avoiding\\nmaterialistic (rajasic and tamasic) tendencies.]\\nKṛṣṇa enumerates daivī-sampat (1 to 3) and āsurī-sampat (4 to\\n21) which is listed below:\\n43Daivī-sampat Āsurī-sampat\\n1.Fearlessness (1) 1.Vanity (4, 10, 14, 15, 17, 18)\\n2.

Kṛṣṇa sums up the entire āsurī-sampat as the\\n44three\\nbasic materialistic traits of desire, anger and greed. They are the\\nthree-fold gateway to hell (21)', ' When one avoids these three traits\\nand adopts the divine virtues, daivī-sampat, one becomes qualified for\\nSelf-knowledge and attains liberation soon (22).\\nThe Lord concludes the chapter by pointing out that śāstra is the\\npramāṇa in determining what is right and wrong.

An ignorant person’s faith will depend on his nature\\nsince he has no scriptural knowledge to guide. (By observing various\\ntypes of worship done by others, he develops his faith according to\\nhis character', ' On the other hand, a person who goes by the scriptural\\nteaching will invariably have sattvic faith) (2, 3).\\nKṛṣṇa differentiates three types of faith based upon the object\\nof worship (4). Even the nature of worship varies according to faith.\\nPeople of tamasic faith take to severe practices involving torture of the\\nbody etc.(5, 6)', '\\n45Having\\nanswered Arjuna’s question, Kṛṣṇa discusses a few more\\ntopics namely food, yajña, tapas and charity, differentiating them into\\nthree types based on the guṇas (7 to 22). (Refer the chart.) [A seeker\\nhas to choose the sattvic type i.e.daivī-sampat and avoid rajasic and\\ntamasic types i.e.āsurī-sampat.]\\nBhagavān concludes the teaching mentioning the significance of\\nthe mantra “ Om tat sat ”', ' This originated from Brahmā’s mouth in\\nthe beginning of creation, and has been traditionally chanted during\\nscriptural activities like yajña, tapas and dāna. The word ‘sat’ has\\nmany meanings like existence, goodness, good action, steadfastness\\nand an action as an offering to the Lord (23 to 27). [In essence the\\nutterance of this mantra will sanctify scriptural actions and make them\\nsattvic.]\\nIn the last verse, Kṛṣṇa emphasizes the importance of śraddhā\\n(faith)', ' Without faith all scriptural activities become asat, i.e.fruitless\\n(28).\\nThe topics of this chapter are:\\n1.Arjuna’s question and three types of śraddhā . . . . . . . . . . . 1 to 6\\n2.Kṛṣṇa introduces new topics . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7\\n3.

Now begins\\nthe XVIII chapter answering Arjuna’s question', ' Bhagavān takes this\\nopportunity to sum up His entire teaching which has been spread over\\nthe last sixteen chapters.\\nThe chapter begins with Arjuna’s question — “Oh Lord! I desire\\nto know the true nature of sannyāsa andtyāga distinctly” (1). Kṛṣṇa\\nreplies by citing the views of some people (2, 3). The Lord gives his\\nverdict from the 4th verse onwards. Bhagavān does not differentiate\\n48sannyāsa andtyāga.\\n(This indicates that they are not different accord-\\ning to the Lord', ') Kṛṣṇa emphasizes the importance of obligatory rites\\n(nityakarma ) like yajña, dāna andtapas, and asserts that they should\\nnever be given up (5, 6) (We should note that this advice is given to\\npeople with impurity. Śāstras allow a person with purity to renounce\\nnityakarma also). In the next three verses, the Lord divides renuncia-\\ntion into three types — tamasic, rajasic and sattvic. (For details see the\\nchart)\\nIn the following verses, Bhagavān glorifies sattvic renunciation', '\\n(In fact, sattvic renunciation is nothing but karmayoga .) Akarmayogī\\nrenounces all the results of action. In due course he gets Self-knowledge.\\nHe is not affected by the consequences whether they are good, evil or\\na mixture of both (10 to 12).\\nFrom the 13th to the 17th verse, Kṛṣṇa gives a gist of jñānayoga.\\nFive factors are involved in every action — the body, prāṇa, the mind\\nwith sense organs, the ego and the presiding divinity of all these', ' (In\\nshort, they are the four kośās and the presiding divinity) (13, 14). All\\nactions, good or evil, are accomplished through these five factors only\\n(15). The Self is not involved in any action. But, due to identification\\nwith the above factors, one mistakes oneself to be a doer (16). On the\\nother hand, the wiseman, who does not have the false ‘I’ ( ahaṅkāra)\\nborn of identification, is free from all karmas in spite of the activities\\nof his equipments. He is neither a doer, nor an enjoyer (17)', '\\nTaking a diversion, Bhagavān introduces six factors necessary\\nfor any vyavahāra (transaction). They are — knower, knowledge, known,\\ndoer, action and the instrument of action (18). Of these six factors,\\nKṛṣṇa takes up three (knowledge, action and doer) for further division\\nbased on the three guṇas (19). Later, the Lord divides the intellect and\\nwill also on the same basis (29). Finally, Kṛṣṇa talks about three types\\nof happiness (36)', ' (For details see the chart)\\nKṛṣṇa concludes this topic by pointing out that there is nothing\\nin the creation which is free from these three guṇas (40).\\nWith an intention to sum up the entire Gītā-teaching, Bhagavān\\ngives the essence of karmayoga (41 to 49) and jñānayoga (50 to 55) in\\nthe following section.\\n49T\\nopic Sattvic Rajasic T\\namasic\\n1.Sannyāsa\\n(Renunciation)Renunciation\\nof the results\\nofnityakarma s.\\n(9)Renunciation of\\nnityakarmas\\ndue to\\nfear of bodily strain', '\\n(8)Renunciation ofnityakarmas\\ndue to\\nthe ignorance of their\\nvalue.

Here, Kṛṣṇa\\nmakes it a point to emphasize the importance of svadharma (duty). It\\nis necessary not only for the sake of purity but for the sake of social\\nharmony also. Shriking one’s duty can only lead to total confusion\\n(47, 48). The purified seeker, who is detached and self-controlled, will\\nsoon attain liberation through jñānayoga (40).\\nNow the Lord introduces jñānayoga and gives a brief outline\\nof meditation i.e', 'nididhyāsanam (which is necessary to assimilate\\nthe knowledge gained through śravaṇam andmananam). Having re-\\nstrained all organs and having given up all disturbing thoughts like de-\\nsire, anger etc., one should remain in a secluded place (51 to 53). Being\\nfirmly established in his Brahman-nature, he becomes free from grief\\nand desire. Being the same to all beings, he enjoys the highest devo-\\ntion to the Lord (54). Having known the Lord in His true nature, he\\nbecomes one with Him (55)', ' (Becoming one is nothing but dropping\\nthe notion of division.)\\nIn the following verses (56 to 63), Kṛṣṇa comes back to kar-\\nmayoga, emphasizing the aspect of devotion i.e.the attitude of sur-\\nrender. Constantly remembering the Lord, if one dedicates all his ac-\\ntions to Him, that devotee attains the Lord ultimately by effortlessly\\ncrossing over all obstacles (56 to 58). On the other hand, if one tries\\nto evade his duty, which is based on his nature, it will be in vain and\\nharmful (58 to 60)', ' Hence, surrendering to the Lord of the heart, the\\ncontroller of all, a devotee should strive to attain supreme peace by His\\ngrace (61 to 62). With this, Bhagavān concludes the teaching and di-\\nrects Arjuna to do whatever he likes (63). But, the affection towards\\nArjuna overpowers Kṛṣṇa once again (64). Hence, the Lord repeats\\nHis teaching emphatically once again — “Fix the mind on Me. (Be)\\nMy devotee. (Be) My worshiper. Surrender to Me. You shall reach\\nMe alone. Truly do I promise to you', ' You are dear to Me. Having\\nrenounced all actions, seek Me, the nondual, (as your) shelter. I shall\\nliberate you from all sins. Do not grieve” (65, 66). (These two verses\\n52are\\npresenting karmayoga andjñānayoga in capsule-form.)\\nHaving thus concluded the teaching, the Lord states the quali-\\nfications necessary to receive this. One who has no faith, discipline,\\ndevotion and desire to know should not be given this knowledge (67).\\nNow comes the phalam', ' One who imparts and the one who re-\\nceives this wisdom attain the Lord Himself (68 to 70). Even the one\\nwho merely hears this with faith attains higher worlds (71).\\nBeing satisfied with the teaching, Kṛṣṇa asksArjuna whether his\\ndelusion is gone. Arjuna gratefully acknowledges, promising to abide\\nby the Lord’s teaching (72, 73).\\nNow Sañjaya addresses Dhṛtarāṣṭra, exclaiming how blessed he\\nwas to listen to this glorious dialogue between the Lord and Arjuna\\n(74, 75)', ' Sañjaya remembers the whole dialogue and the cosmic vision\\nwith thrill (76, 77). He concludes his remarks with the declaration —\\n“Where there is Kṛṣṇa, the Lord of yoga, and where there is Arjuna, the\\nwielder of the bow, there will be permanent wealth, victory, prosperity\\nand justice” (78).\\nThe topics of this chapter are:\\n1.Sannyāsa andtyāga . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 to 12\\n2.Jñānayoga . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
